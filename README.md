# Figma Project Repository ðŸŽ¨

This repository contains my Figma design files. It serves as a backup and version control for my design work.

I am a Full Stack Developer with expertise in building scalable web applications. Alongside my development skills, I have also learned the fundamentals of UI/UX design and Figma to create user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. My focus is on delivering efficient and intuitive digital solutions by combining front-end and back-end technologies with thoughtful design principles. This repository includes my Figma design files, serving as a reference for my UI/UX learning journey. I am continuously improving my skills in both development and design to enhance user experience and functionality in my projects. Feel free to explore and provide feedback.
